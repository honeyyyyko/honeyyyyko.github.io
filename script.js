Today marks my first day of courting you, and honestly, I still can't believe this is really happening. I prayed for this moment for the chance to show you how much you mean to me.

Parang panaginip lang na I'm here already, finally taking this step towards you. I've admired you, and now that I get to express it, I promise I won't waste this chance.

Every time I see your smile, it feels like the world softens like roses blooming in spring. And when I see your pretty face? It reminds me of daisies dancing in the sun.

I hope, as you read this, you feel how genuine my intentions are. You're really special to me, and this, right here, is the start of something I'll always treasure.

With all my heart,  
Your Hon :))`

Enjoy every moment, my Honey. Kahit gaano ka-busy or pagod today, please remember that someone out here is always cheering for you, thinking of you, and wishing you the best.

You make my world brighter just by being you.  
Have a wonderful day. 🌹

The whole night ako nag-iisip about you how you've been, what you're doing, if you're smiling right now. I just hope you're okay, and that you know how much I you mean to me. You always make my days brighter, kahit minsan may mga maliit na tampuhan.
