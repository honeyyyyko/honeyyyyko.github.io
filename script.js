Today marks my first day of courting you, and honestly, I still can’t believe this is really happening. I prayed for this moment for the chance to show you how much you mean to me.

Parang panaginip lang na I'm here already, finally taking this step towards you. I’ve admired you, and now that I get to express it, I promise I won’t waste this chance.

Every time I see your smile, it feels like the world softens like roses blooming in spring. And when I see your pretty face? It reminds me of daisies dancing in the sun.

I hope, as you read this, you feel how genuine my intentions are. You’re really special to me, and this, right here, is the start of something I’ll always treasure.

With all my heart,  
Your Hon :))`

I just wanted to remind you how special you are to me. Every day that I get to talk to you or even think of you feels like a blessing I’ll never get tired of thanking God for.

I hope today brings you nothing but peace, happiness, and smiles the kind that light up your face and make my heart skip a beat. May your day be filled with good vibes, laughter, and the warmth of people who love you… especially me.

Enjoy every moment, my Honey. Kahit gaano ka-busy or pagod today, please remember that someone out here is always cheering for you, thinking of you, and wishing you the best.

You make my world brighter just by being you.  
Have a wonderful day. 🌹

Yours truly,
Honnnn`

I just want to say na I really enjoyed po our lambingan last night. Ang saya lang ng mga moments na ganon po. Every time we laugh or tease each other, it feels like I’m getting even closer to you.

Sorry pala sa mga pang-iinis ko hehe 😅 alam mo namang ang kulit ko po minsan. Pero to be honest, I just love seeing you smile especially when it’s because of me.

I hope today treats you gently, Honey. May your day be filled with warmth, peace, and little moments that make you smile again. Always remember, I’m just here thinking of you, praying for you, and feeling grateful that I get to do this.

You make my every day something worth looking forward to. ❤️  

With love,  
Your makulit na Honn 😛`

Good morning cutie 

I’m so happy knowing you had such a productive day kahapon. I’m always proud of how dedicated and hardworking you are. You make everything you do look so effortless, and it inspires me more than you know.

Pero sana this time, may pahinga ka rin kahit konti po ha? You deserve to rest and enjoy every little thing around you.

I’ve been thinking about you a lot, your smile, your voice, the way you tell stories about your day. It already makes my day complete.

Keep shining, my Honey. I’ll always be here, cheering for you quietly and praying for more good days ahead. You’re doing amazing po and I’m just so lucky I get to witness it.

With all my love,  
Honnn`

I just want to say na superrr ganda mo talaga. As in, pretty ka, cute pa, and you have a good heart po. Hindi lang sa itsura, pero sa kung paano ka makitungo, mag-alaga, at magpahalaga sa mga tao sa paligid mo.

You make things feel lighter just by being yourself.

So today, sana good mood ka lang ha? Smile ka palagi, kahit pagod ka or stress. You deserve all the good things in the world, and I’ll keep reminding you of that.

Ingat ka palagi, Honey. I’m always proud of you. 💖

(PS. Sorry po pala kagabi honeyyy, nainis ka tuloy sa akin. I'm really sorry po talaga, bati na tayo okay?)

Wala ka po palang pasok today. Sana you really take this time to rest and enjoy your day. You’ve been working so hard lately, kaya deserve mo talaga ‘tong pahinga.

Spend the day doing things that make you happy kahit mag sleep ka, watch a movie, or just chill quietly. Gusto ko lang na makapag-relax ka, walang stress, walang pressure.

And syempre, kahit wala kang pasok, gusto ko pa rin sabihin… ang ganda mo po pa rin. 

Enjoy your rest day, Honey. You deserve every bit of peace and comfort today. Miss you already. 💖

Thank you for updating me, Honey. I’m happy knowing you’re there enjoying your little vacation, deserve mo po yan after being so productive these past days.

Sana you’re having a fun time with your family po ah? You’ve been working hard, so this is your time to just breathe and smile.

I can already imagine you there, all pretty and happy, enjoying the day. Grabe, kahit malayo ka, parang andito ka pa rin kasi you never leave my thoughts 😎

Take care palagi, Honey. Don’t forget to rest din ah? I’ll be here lang, waiting for your kwentos when you get back.

  content: `Dear Honey ko,

I’ve been thinking about the message I sent you last night. Hindi ko talaga maiwasan na mag-isip, kasi I care about you so much. Ayokong may ilangan or anything that could make you feel uncomfortable with me.

If ever may nasabi akong mali or something that made you feel off, I’m really sorry, Honey. Alam mo naman, di ko naman po sinasadya. I just want things between us to stay light, happy, and full of good memories.

The whole night ako nag-iisip about you how you’ve been, what you’re doing, if you’re smiling right now. I just hope you’re okay, and that you know how much I you mean to me. You always make my days brighter, kahit minsan may mga maliit na tampuhan.

Have a calm and happy day today, Honey. Smile ka palagi ha? You’re too precious to let little things steal your peace.  

– Your Honn`

  content: `Dear Honey ko,

You told me you’re scared to sleep po. Sana andyan lang ako beside you right now po holding your hand, telling you everything’s okay. I’d cuddle you to sleep if I could, just to make sure you feel safe and calm.

Alam mo, Honey, it’s okay to feel scared minsan. Pero please remember, you’re never alone. Kahit di ako physically beside you, my thoughts and my care are always with you. Close your eyes and imagine me right there.

I hope your sleep po brings you peace, soft dreams, and a quiet heart. You deserve to rest peacefully after all the things you’ve been doing. Wag ka masyadong matakot ok honey? You’re safe, and I’m always just one message and call away po.

Sleep well, my Honey. I’ll be praying that you wake up later with a smile. 💛  

– Your Honn`
