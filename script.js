Today marks my first day of courting you, and honestly, I still can‚Äôt believe this is really happening. I prayed for this moment for the chance to show you how much you mean to me.

Parang panaginip lang na I'm here already, finally taking this step towards you. I‚Äôve admired you, and now that I get to express it, I promise I won‚Äôt waste this chance.

Every time I see your smile, it feels like the world softens like roses blooming in spring. And when I see your pretty face? It reminds me of daisies dancing in the sun.

I hope, as you read this, you feel how genuine my intentions are. You‚Äôre really special to me, and this, right here, is the start of something I‚Äôll always treasure.

With all my heart,  
Your Hon :))`

I just wanted to remind you how special you are to me. Every day that I get to talk to you or even think of you feels like a blessing I‚Äôll never get tired of thanking God for.

I hope today brings you nothing but peace, happiness, and smiles the kind that light up your face and make my heart skip a beat. May your day be filled with good vibes, laughter, and the warmth of people who love you‚Ä¶ especially me.

Enjoy every moment, my Honey. Kahit gaano ka-busy or pagod today, please remember that someone out here is always cheering for you, thinking of you, and wishing you the best.

You make my world brighter just by being you.  
Have a wonderful day. üåπ

Good morning cutie 

I‚Äôm so happy knowing you had such a productive day kahapon. I‚Äôm always proud of how dedicated and hardworking you are. You make everything you do look so effortless, and it inspires me more than you know.

Pero sana this time, may pahinga ka rin kahit konti po ha? You deserve to rest and enjoy every little thing around you.

I‚Äôve been thinking about you a lot, your smile, your voice, the way you tell stories about your day. It already makes my day complete.

Keep shining, my Honey. I‚Äôll always be here, cheering for you quietly and praying for more good days ahead. You‚Äôre doing amazing po and I‚Äôm just so lucky I get to witness it.

With all my love,

I just want to say na superrr ganda mo talaga. As in, pretty ka, cute pa, and you have a good heart po. Hindi lang sa itsura, pero sa kung paano ka makitungo, mag-alaga, at magpahalaga sa mga tao sa paligid mo.

You make things feel lighter just by being yourself.

So today, sana good mood ka lang ha? Smile ka palagi, kahit pagod ka or stress. You deserve all the good things in the world, and I‚Äôll keep reminding you of that.

Ingat ka palagi, Honey. I‚Äôm always proud of you. üíñ

Wala ka palang pasok today, lucky you! Sana you really take this time to rest and enjoy your day. You‚Äôve been working so hard lately, kaya deserve mo talaga ‚Äòtong pahinga.

Spend the day doing things that make you happy kahit mag sleep ka, watch a movie, or just chill quietly. Gusto ko lang na makapag-relax ka, walang stress, walang pressure.

And syempre, kahit wala kang pasok, gusto ko pa rin sabihin‚Ä¶ ang ganda mo po pa rin. 

Enjoy your rest day, Honey. You deserve every bit of peace and comfort today. Miss you already. üíñ
