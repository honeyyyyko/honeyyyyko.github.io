Today marks my first day of courting you, and honestly, I still can‚Äôt believe this is really happening. I prayed for this moment for the chance to show you how much you mean to me.

Parang panaginip lang na I'm here already, finally taking this step towards you. I‚Äôve admired you, and now that I get to express it, I promise I won‚Äôt waste this chance.

Every time I see your smile, it feels like the world softens like roses blooming in spring. And when I see your pretty face? It reminds me of daisies dancing in the sun.

I hope, as you read this, you feel how genuine my intentions are. You‚Äôre really special to me, and this, right here, is the start of something I‚Äôll always treasure.

With all my heart,  
Your Hon :))`

I just wanted to remind you how special you are to me. Every day that I get to talk to you or even think of you feels like a blessing I‚Äôll never get tired of thanking God for.

I hope today brings you nothing but peace, happiness, and smiles the kind that light up your face and make my heart skip a beat. May your day be filled with good vibes, laughter, and the warmth of people who love you‚Ä¶ especially me.

Enjoy every moment, my Honey. Kahit gaano ka-busy or pagod today, please remember that someone out here is always cheering for you, thinking of you, and wishing you the best.

You make my world brighter just by being you.  
Have a wonderful day. üåπ

Yours truly,
Honnnn`
